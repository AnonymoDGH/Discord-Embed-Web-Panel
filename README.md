# Discord-Embed-Web-Panel Infomration

 This is a system where I modified my Discord Pager System which can be found in the **Notes** category in the **README.md** file. This is a program/system that connects your discord bot to a website, then it allows you to make custom embeds with the bot and post them into the discord with your custom data. Everything can be changed and edited within the files on what you want in your embed but I made it so it has everything possible in an embed. In order for it to work you have to do the following;

Enter your data in the `config.json`

Then you can go to your console and do `npm test` to run the code and the website will go online `(http://127.0.0.1:5665/?token=123456)` You can change the port and token in the `config.json`!
